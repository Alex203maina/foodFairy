### Importance
Food insecurity is a global challenge, and efficiently managing food donations can significantly reduce waste and ensure that food gets to those who need it most. **Food Fairy** addresses this by:
- **Ensuring Accountability**: Track every food donation from the moment it’s received to when it reaches beneficiaries.
- **Improving Efficiency**: By managing distribution centers and deliveries, the system ensures food is delivered promptly and to the right location.
- **Supporting Dietary Needs**: Track dietary restrictions for beneficiaries, ensuring that the food they receive is suitable for their needs.
- **Preventing Food Waste**: Monitor food shelf life and manage perishable items to reduce food spoilage.
  
With the **Food Fairy** system, food distribution becomes more organized and effective, helping communities combat hunger more efficiently.

### How to Use
1. **Track Food Donors**: Keep records of who is donating food, including individuals and organizations.
2. **Manage Beneficiaries**: Register individuals, families, and institutions (e.g., children’s homes) who receive donations, including family sizes and dietary restrictions.
3. **Monitor Distribution Centers**: Manage locations where food is stored and track their capacity.
4. **Log Donations**: Record the type of food, its quantity, and its donor for easy inventory management.
5. **Handle Deliveries**: Track food deliveries from distribution centers to beneficiaries with real-time updates.
