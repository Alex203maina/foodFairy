## Food Fairy: Food Distribution Management System

### Overview
The **Food Fairy** is a food distribution management system developed to streamline the process of getting food to those in need. The system allows communities and organizations to efficiently manage food donations, track beneficiaries, and ensure the right food reaches the right people at the right time. It provides essential tools for tracking donations, managing distribution centers, and overseeing food deliveries.

### Importance
Food insecurity is a global challenge, and efficiently managing food donations can significantly reduce waste and ensure that food gets to those who need it most. **Food Fairy** addresses this by:
- **Ensuring Accountability**: Track every food donation from the moment it’s received to when it reaches beneficiaries.
- **Improving Efficiency**: By managing distribution centers and deliveries, the system ensures food is delivered promptly and to the right location.
- **Supporting Dietary Needs**: Track dietary restrictions for beneficiaries, ensuring that the food they receive is suitable for their needs.
- **Preventing Food Waste**: Monitor food shelf life and manage perishable items to reduce food spoilage.
  
With the **Food Fairy** system, food distribution becomes more organized and effective, helping communities combat hunger more efficiently.

### How to Use
1. **Track Food Donors**: Keep records of who is donating food, including individuals and organizations.
2. **Manage Beneficiaries**: Register individuals, families, and institutions (e.g., children’s homes) who receive donations, including family sizes and dietary restrictions.
3. **Monitor Distribution Centers**: Manage locations where food is stored and track their capacity.
4. **Log Donations**: Record the type of food, its quantity, and its donor for easy inventory management.
5. **Handle Deliveries**: Track food deliveries from distribution centers to beneficiaries with real-time updates.
